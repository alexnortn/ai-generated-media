Never play to the gallery I think. But you never learn that until much later on I
think. Never work for other people what you do always, always remember that
the reason that you initially started working was that there was something
inside yourself that you felt that if you could manifest it in some way you
would understand more about yourself and how you coexist with the rest of society.

I think it's terribly dangerous for an artist to fulfill other people's expectations. 
I think they generally produced their worst work when they do that.

The other thing I would say is that if you feel safe in the area that you're 
working in you're not working in the right area always go a little further into the
water than you feel you're capable of being and go a little bit out of your
depth and when you don't feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom
you're just about in the right place to do something exciting.
